### Summary

The local cloud collaborative proposes to colocate a server rack within Burlington Telecom's gigabit network. Using this server rack, the local cloud collaborative will make cloud computing resources available for non-commercial Internet applications with a focus on public, educational, and government access. With an uplink to Burlington Telecom's gigabit network, the local cloud will provide the infrastructure and platform on which to deploy next-generation Internet applications.
